# NLP final project - Wesley Chen, Jake Zweifler

## Project Summary
### Project short description:
Metaphors are pervasive in natural language, and detecting them requires challenging contextual reasoning about whether specific situations can actually happen. The metaphorical usage of certain terms is highly reflective of underlying sentiment and meaning and can convey far more about the intended thoughts of the writer or speaker than literal language. Given the highly context-sensitive nature of metaphorical language, it can be more difficult to model using only text data. 

### Main references:
Neural Metaphor Detection in Context (https://aclanthology.org/D18-1060/)

### Minimal requirement:
Reproduce Table 5 and Table 6 (excluding the performance metrics for other models, i.e. excluding the middle 4 rows)
Repeat the experiments with BERT

### Extra credit:
Write more extensively about why metaphor detection and interpretation is a useful task (or not) for the NLP community to work on. In addition, consider what makes the tasks of Metaphor detection (as the works in this paper addresses) and metaphor interpretation (not addressed by this paper) challenging.
